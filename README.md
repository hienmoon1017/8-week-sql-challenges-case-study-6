## Result of Questions
### 1. Data Cleansing Steps
 ```sql
-- Convert product_id of page_hierarchy to integer
UPDATE clique_bait.page_hierarchy
SET product_id = case when product_id = 'null' then null
						else product_id
						end;

ALTER TABLE clique_bait.page_hierarchy
ADD COLUMN cl_product_id integer;

UPDATE clique_bait.page_hierarchy
SET cl_product_id = product_id :: integer;
```
### 2. Digital Analysis
